# Compressor-Decompressor
Compressor and Decompressor Project
1. File Compression
2. File Decompression

> **File Compression:** File Compression helps you to shrink your files into a more compact size without compromising on data Integrity. The file compressor ensures that the file remains intact throughout the entire compression process, this not only saves space but makes file sharing easier.

> **File Decompression:** When the time has come to retrieve the compressed file, the decompression feature restores the file to its original state, ensuring that no data is lost during the entire process.

The User Interface is very friendly with only 2 simple options.
